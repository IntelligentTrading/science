"""The :mod:`algorithms` module is intended to contain some specific algorithms
in order to execute very common evolutionary algorithms. The method used here
are more for convenience than reference as the implementation of every
evolutionary algorithm may vary infinitely. Most of the algorithms in this
module use operators registered in the toolbox. Generally, the keyword used are
:meth:`mate` for crossover, :meth:`mutate` for mutation, :meth:`~deap.select`
for selection and :meth:`evaluate` for evaluation.

You are encouraged to write your own algorithms in order to make them do what
you really want them to do.

    presented in chapter 7 of [Back2000]_.

    :param population: A list of individuals.
    :param toolbox: A :class:`~deap.base.Toolbox` that contains the evolution
                    operators.
    :param cxpb: The probability of mating two individuals.
    :param mutpb: The probability of mutating an individual.
    :param ngen: The number of generation.
    :param stats: A :class:`~deap.tools.Statistics` object that is updated
                  inplace, optional.
    :param halloffame: A :class:`~deap.tools.HallOfFame` object that will
                       contain the best individuals, optional.
    :param verbose: Whether or not to log the statistics.
    :returns: The final population
    :returns: A class:`~deap.tools.Logbook` with the statistics of the
              evolution

    The algorithm takes in a population and evolves it in place using the
    :meth:`varAnd` method. It returns the optimized population and a
    :class:`~deap.tools.Logbook` with the statistics of the evolution. The
    logbook will contain the generation number, the number of evalutions for
    each generation and the statistics if a :class:`~deap.tools.Statistics` is
    given as argument. The *cxpb* and *mutpb* arguments are passed to the
    :func:`varAnd` function. The pseudocode goes as follow ::

        evaluate(population)
        for g in range(ngen):
            population = select(population, len(population))
            offspring = varAnd(population, toolbox, cxpb, mutpb)
            evaluate(offspring)
            population = offspring

    As stated in the pseudocode above, the algorithm goes as follow. First, it
    evaluates the individuals with an invalid fitness. Second, it enters the
    generational loop where the selection procedure is applied to entirely
    replace the parental population. The 1:1 replacement ratio of this
    algorithm **requires** the selection procedure to be stochastic and to
    select multiple times the same individual, for example,
    :func:`~deap.tools.selTournament` and :func:`~deap.tools.selRoulette`.
    Third, it applies the :func:`varAnd` function to produce the next
    generation population. Fourth, it evaluates the new individuals and
    compute the statistics on this population. Finally, when *ngen*
    generations are done, the algorithm returns a tuple with the final
    population and a :class:`~deap.tools.Logbook` of the evolution.

    .. note::

        Using a non-stochastic selection method will result in no selection as
        the operator selects *n* individuals from a pool of *n*.

    This function expects the :meth:`toolbox.mate`, :meth:`toolbox.mutate`,
    :meth:`toolbox.select` and :meth:`toolbox.evaluate` aliases to be
    registered in the toolbox.
